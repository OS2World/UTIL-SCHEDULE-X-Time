It is not much but I intend to upgrade it when time permits.

                              ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS to the

     MIN                      Sets the default state for the 
                              starting session as MINIMIZED 
                              (ICONIC) (valid only for PM or WIN
                              application)

     MAX                      Sets the default state for the 
                              starting session as MAXIMIZED 
                              (ICONIC) (valid only for PM or WIN

     CMD                      indicates to start the program    
                              specified invoking CMD.EXE 

     K                        indicates to invoke CMD.EXE with
                              the /K option. this parameter keeps
                              the session when the program
                              specified terminate   

NOTE:

If a full qualified file name is used to specify the program name
the command will search first in the same path and then in the
PATH for an ICON file to associate to the starting session, else
only the PATH will be searched.
If no file named as the specified program name, but with "ICO" as
last qualifier is found a default ICON will be used.
